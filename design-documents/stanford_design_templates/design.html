<h1>How to Write a Design Document</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to read through this entire page. It's all relevent.</li>
  <li>Each design document is worth 40% of the project. While it will
likely take less than 40% of the time you spend on the project, you
should take it very seriously. </li>
  <li>We will grade your designs harshly.
The design is essentially the most important part of the
project. Having a good project design can literally cut your total
coding
time by a factor of 10. </li>
  <li>Design documents should be around 2,000 to 4,000 words long. If
it's
longer than 5,000 words, we won't read it. So keep'em short and to the
point. </li>
  <li>Design documents will be submitted online, in PDF, HTML, or text
format. We encourage you to use your favorite word processor to make
your design document, but you must convert it to PDF or text when
you're done. We'll provide basic directions on how to do that. </li>
  <li>Here's a <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs162/fa10/sample-project.html">sample project</a> and a <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs162/fa10/sample-design.html">sample design</a> for it. The sample
project is only a fraction of the length of your projects, though. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What goes into a design document?</h2>
<p>
A design document is a complete high-level solution to the problem
presented. It should be detailed enough that somebody who already
understands the problem could go out and code the project without
having to make any significant decisions. Further, if this somebody
happens to be an experienced coder, they should be able to use the
design document to code the solution in a few hours (not necessarily
including debugging).
</p>
<p>
So what actually goes in?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A high-level description of your solution, including <b>design
decisions</b> and <b>data structures</b> </li>
  <li><b>Declarations</b> for all new classes, procedures, and
global/class variables </li>
  <li><b>Descriptions</b> of all new procedures (unless you can tell
exactly
what it does from the name), including the purpose of the procedure,
and an explanation of how it works and/or pseudocode </li>
</ul>
<p> For example, this is the pseudocode I would write for the
existing <font face="Courier New">Condition::Wait</font>:
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">void Condition::Wait()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiter = new Semaphore, initially 0
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;append waiter to waitQueue
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditionLock-&gt;Release()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiter-&gt;P()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditionLock-&gt;Acquire()
</span></p>
<p>
Your pseudocode has to be precise. For instance, in describing your
solution for the
<font face="Courier New">Communicator</font> class, it is not enough
to say
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New">if anybody's waiting, then
signal cv
</font><br>
You need to say how you determine if anybody's waiting, e.g. by saying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New">if (waitingReceivers&gt;0 or
waitingSenders&gt;0) then signal cv</font>
</p>
<p>Also, another important thing to remember is that a design document
needs to
include the <b>correctness invariants</b> and <b>testing strategy</b>. The testing
strategy includes a clear plan of the testing methodology and may include a description of test cases that will be used to
test correctness invariants. Focus on the testing strategy. If you
want, you may itemize things that will need testing.<!--, but do not actually state your test cases in your design

document. Test cases are really boring to read, and we have to read around 13

or so design documents per project.-->
</p>
<h2>What <i>doesn't</i> go into a design document?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that your TA understands the project very well.
Do not restate the
problem in your design document. Your TA is far more interested in
your solution than in knowing that you understood the problem.
</p>
<p>
Your design document should contain very little actual code, if
any at all. Include psuedocode for all complex procedures, but do not
include Java code.
</p>
<p>The purpose
of pseudocode is to avoid all the annoying aspects of programming
languages that make code both harder to write and harder to read. The
purpose of pseudocode is <i>not</i> to be imprecise about how you
solve
a problem. Comments are welcome, but ASSERT and DEBUG statements, for
example, do not belong in pseudocode.
</p>
<p>
Remember that we have to <i>read</i> your design documents. If you
don't think we want to see it, don't put it in!
</p>
<h2>How do I convert <i>x</i> to PDF?</h2>
First convert to postscript:
<ul>
  <li>Raw text: use enscript on an instructional machine. </li>
  <li>HTML: Run netscape on an instructional machine and print to a
file. </li>
  <li>Word Document: Convert it to HTML, or try the next alternative. </li>
  <li>Anything viewable in Windows: install a postscript printer driver
(e.g. HP Laserjet 5 Postscript) and print your document to a file. It
will have the .prn extension. Change the .prn to .ps and it should
work fine. </li>
</ul>
Then run the <tt>ps2pdf</tt> command on an instructional machine.
<p>Be sure to make sure your .pdf file works before you turn it in (try
viewing it with gs, gsview, or acroread).
</p>
<h2>How do I submit a design document?</h2>
<p>Place your design in a file called <tt>projN-initial-design.[pdf/txt/html]</tt>,
where <tt>N</tt> is the project number. For project 1, your design
document should be called <tt>proj1-initial-design.[pdf/txt/html]</tt>. Then
run
</p>
<pre>  tar cf projN-initial-design.tar projN-initial-design.[pdf/txt/html]<br></pre>
followed by
<pre>  gzip projN-initial-design.tar<br></pre>
<p>Now, in the directory containing <tt>projN-initial-design.tar.gz</tt>, run
</p>
<pre>  submit projN-initial-design<br></pre>
again, subtituting the project number for <tt>N</tt>. For project 1,
you would type
<pre>  submit proj1-initial-design<br></pre>

To submit the final design doc, you similarly create a <tt>projN-final-design.[pdf/txt/html]</tt>
and repeat the process, with 'initial' replaced with 'final'.
